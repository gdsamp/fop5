    "## Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract:\n",
    "The purpose of this report is to investigate the spread of infection over time from a 'World' population consisting of an initial uninfected population and an initial infected population, and how this spread is affected by different variable parameters of interest. The simulation has been extended in multiple ways to increase the realistic nature of an infectious disease by incorporating additional functions of recovery, immunity and death of the initial population, that are a result of their respective probabilities, as well as accomodating to various user inputs (command line arguments) and outputs (statistics). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expectations:**\n",
    "<br>With some degree of accuracy, this investigation aims to investigate the increased number of infected people within a world, and consequently, how the counts of additional behaviours such as immunity, recovery and death result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters of interest:\n",
    "Where the **parameters of interest** are:\n",
    "1. Initial uninfected population  (integer > 0)\n",
    "2. Initial infected population    (integer > 0)\n",
    "3. Probability of infection       ( 0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "4. Probability of recovery        ( 0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "5. Probability of death           (0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "6. Probability of immunity        ( 0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "7. Neighbourhood,  \n",

    "## Background:\n",
    "Purpose of the simulation is to analyse how, when constrained within borders and barriers, the disease within different worlds spreads as time goes on, subject to additional behaviours of recovery, immunity and death. More extensions have been implemented to improve the realistic nature of the simultion as well as the flexibility of the program to user inputs, such as the addition of command line arguments to run the program directly and through the bash script when conducting the parameter sweep.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial uninfected population: An integer greater than zero that represents the number of uninfected people initially in the simulation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initial infected population: An integer greater than zero that represents the number of infected people initially in the simulation.   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Probability of infection: A decimal value greater than or equal to 0 but smaller than or equal to 1. This parameter is chosen to determine the degree of infectiousness of the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Probability of recovery: A decimal value greater than or equal to 0 but smaller than or equal to 1. This parameter is chosen to determine the degree of vulnerability of the disease itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Probability of death: A decimal value greater than or equal to 0 but smaller than or equal to 1. This parameter is chosen to determine how fatal the disease is. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Probability of immunity: A decimal value greater than or equal to 0 but smaller than or equal to 1. This parameter is chosen to determine the possibility of immunity from recovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Neighbourhood: A choice between Moore or Von Neumann neighbourhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology:\n",
    "<br>Through a bash script, we are able to compare the different simulations as the initial uninfected population changes and all other parameters of interest remain constant.\n",

    "# Conclusion:\n",
    "<br>From the results, it is possible to conclude that an increase in an initial uninfected population increased the spread of disease. This may be due to the increased readily available people that have the opportunity to become infected. \n",
    "<br>The program AdiseaseSim.py simulates the spread of disease with additional behaviours of death, immunity and recovery along with other implemented functions. In addition, the program has been extended to cater for user input of parameters of interest, movement of people in the populations (Moore and Von Neumann), borders and barriers and has been used within a bash script to conduct a parameter sweep.\n",
    "<br>The overall simulation of the spread of disease culd be further improved by adding additional behavioural functions. Functions such as an 'Airport' for easy movement between the 2 hemispheres of the World, adding a doctor/hospital to the simulation that allows people to be treated/healed from the infection, thus, affecting the number of recovered, infected and consequently dead people. Further extensions that would increase the realistic nature of the simulation, such as reproduction over time, adding new uninfected or immune people to the world as well as death by old age, rather than just by infection. \n",
