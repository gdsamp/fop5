    "# Overview: AdiseaseSim.py \n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose: \n",
    "The Python program AdiseaseSim.py is created to simulate the spread of infection from an initial population consisting of an initial uninfected population (INIT_POP) and an initial infected population(INIT_INF). The program has been extended to increase the realistic nature of an infectious disease by incorporating additional functions of recovery, immunity and death of the initial population, that are a result of their respective probabilities chosen by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the program directly:  \n",
    "\n",
    "The program AdiseaseSim.py has been extended to allow for user input of the parameters of interest, on the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where the **parameters of interest** are:\n",
    "1. Initial uninfected population  (integer > 0)\n",
    "2. Initial infected population    (integer > 0)\n",
    "3. Probability of infection       ( 0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "4. Probability of recovery        ( 0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "5. Probability of death           (0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "6. Probability of immunity        ( 0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "7. Neighbourhood,  \n",
    "  can be given respectively. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Running the program from a parameter sweep:\n",
    "<br>The bash script **disease_sim1.sh** has been created to view multiple simulations of the spread of disease with a variable parameter of interest. \n",
    "<br>The bash script **disease_sim1.sh** has been created to conduct the parameter sweep with command line arguments.\n",
    "**disease_sim1.sh** incorporates start, stop and step values for the 'probability of infection' parameter (3), which can be chosen by the user and input into the command line to automate the simulations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>**Command line arguments:**\n",
    "1. **Start** Value for the initial uninfected population  (0 <= probability <= 1)\n",
    "2. **Step** value for the initial uninfected population   (0 <= probability <= 1)\n",

    "**Size** \n",
    "<br>Size of the data points in the simulated world corresponds to the number of people in one position  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Barriers/Borders:**\n",
    "<br>Black border on the edge of the grid preventing people and infection from leaving the grid.\n",
    "<br>Black barrier in the centre of the grid that ristricts the movement of people and infection from one side of the grid to the other.\n",
    "<br>The black central barrier in the grid has two gaps, allowing the people of the simulation to move through from one side to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neighbourhood:**\n",
    "<br>The program allows for selection between a 'Moore' and 'Von Neumann' neighbourhood:\n",
    "* A Moore neighbourhood allows for movement of people in all directions (North, North-East, East, South-East, South, South-West, West, North-West and North).\n",
    "* A Von Neumann neighbourhood restricts how the people of the simulation can move, allowing for movement in only North, East, South and West directions. \n",

    "\n",
    "# Implementation of extentions\n",
    "## Extension 1: Moore and Von Neumann\n",
    "<br>**Concept:**\n",
    "<br>The Moore neighbourhood allows movement of people in all directions (North, North-East, East, South-East, South, South-West, West, North-West and North). Whereas, the use of the Von Neumann neighbourhood restricts the movement of people to up, down, left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension 2: Additional behaviours\n",
    "<br>**Concept:**\n",
    "<br>To simulate death from infection within the world as the infection becomes terminal.\n",
    "<br>As well as to simulate the recovery from the infection in it's initial stages or when treated early. Additional simulation of immunity from the recovered population as some people become immune after recovery was implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension 3: Output Statistics\n",
    "<br>**Concept:**\n",
    "<br>Display a written account of how the initial World population has changed throughout the simulation, displaying output statistics of initial infected, uninfected population numbers and final infected, uninfected, immune and death people populations. Other percentage statistics have been implemented to easily see the increases/decreases in the parameters of interest through the timesteps and when compared to a single changing parameter of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension 4: barriers/border\n",
    "<br>**concept:**\n",
    "<br>The implementation of a border allows for the infected, uninfected and immune populations to be constrained within the simulation World. Additionally, a barrier separating one side of the world (Western hemisphere) from the other (Eastern hemisphere) is administered to show the behaviour of infection in 2 seperate parts of the world. \n",
    "<br>Pathways (gaps in the barrier) between the two hemispheres allow a person to pass through, potentially allowing disease to spread from one side of the world to the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension 5: Command line arguments\n",
    "**Concept:**\n",
    "<br>Advanced code to allow for user inputs on the command line, rather than changing the code within the program. This allows for desired parameters of interest to be changed and for different outputs to be observed with ease. For example: user is able to view the change on the final number of people infected as the initial uninfected population is changed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Extension 6: Parameter Sweep\n",
    "**Concept:**\n",
    "<br>Creation of a bash script to run a parameter sweep, to make the simulation much easier when we want to investigate how the spread of disease changes as a single parameter of interest changes.   \n",
    "<br>The parameter sweep automates the process of changing the initial uninfected population after each set (30) of timesteps is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code:\n",
    "<br> **Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>distribute(grid, num_r, num_c, numpeep): The \"distribute\" function initially distributes random data points (e.g. INIT_POP) for a grid within the bound of the boundaries. It is applied to the uninfected grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>distributeinf(grid, num_r, num_c, numpeep): the \"distributeinf\" function is used to initially distribute random data points (e.g. INIT_INF) within a restricted area of a grid to be able to view the spread of disease when applied to the infected grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>vonneumannmovepeeps(cur, next, r, c): This function allows people in the simulated grid (cur) to move. The use of the Von Neumann neighbourhood restricts the movement to up, down, left or right as well as keeps the movement of people, and infection to stay within the bounds of the barriers/borders. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>mooremovepeeps(cur, next, r, c):  This function allows for movement of people in all directions (North, North-East, East, South-East, South, South-West, West, North-West and North), while still restricting the movement of people within the barrier/borders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>infect(inf, notinf, r, c, prob): This function utilises the user input probability of infection to simulate the spread of infection from the infected people to the non-infected people. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>death(inf, notinf, r, c, prob): This function utilises the user input for probability of death to simulate the death of infected people as the infection becomes terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>recovery(inf, notinf, immu, r, c, probimmune): This function involves the user input of 'probability of recovery' and 'probability of immunity' to simulate infected people recovering from the infection, and consequently, an additional option of recovered people becoming immune from recovering from the infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>count(variable): This function counts the number of people of the grids of interest (variable). \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>showresults(): This function is used to print the initial and final statistics of the simulation. E.g. number of infected people at the end of the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>**barrier/Borders**\n",
    "<br>**Design:**\n",
    "<br>The incorporation of a 'world' grid, allows the user to view the borders on the edge on the central column of the grid. \n",
    "<br>This was done by creating a new array of ones, and using slicing to assign zeros to all points on the grid that lie within the boundaries. \n",
    "<br>In addition, the same concept was used to then assign ones to the 'world' grid in the central column to create the barrier. \n",
    "<br>Additional code was then added to the function 'plotgrids' to assign black dot points to the ones of this 'world' grid.\n",
    "<br>**Implementation:**\n",
    "<br>Through adjusting the 'Distribute' function, the function distributes all people within the borders and not on the barrier.\n",
    "<br> Additional code was then added to the 'mooremovepeeps' and 'vonneumannmovepeeps' functions to restrict the movement of people to be contained within the border and around the barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>**Gaps in the barrier**\n",
    "<br>**Design:**\n",
    "<br>Assign zeros to two points [25,36], [25,15] on the 'world' grid to create two visible gaps.\n",
    "<br>**Implementation:**\n",
    "<br> Additional code was added to the 'mooremovepeeps' and 'vonneumannmovepeeps' functions to allow people to move between the two sides of the barrier through the gaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>**Command Line arguments:**\n",
    "<br> Extention to the AdiseaseSim.py program to allow for command line arguments. initially done by importing sys, and assigning parameters of interest to command line arguments 1 to 7. \n",
