    "## Abstract\n",
    "The purpose of this report is to investigate the life cycles of simulated brine shrimp, consisting of an initial population of eggs spawned in random location. The program has been extended from the base simulation to increase the realism with which the shrimp move, detect collisions between shrimp and for new shrimp to be spawned via sexual reproduction mechanics. User inputs are accepted via the parameter sweep extension, and users may also choose to use a demo mode. Images of timesteps are output to a folder.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "This simulation has been developed to analyse how a pre-defined population of shrimp eggs changes and grows based on initial parameters that can be defined by the user. The extensions created \n",

    "<br> The simulation has been extended to include two additional life cycle stages, hatchling and juvenile, on top of the existing egg and adult stages. Each life cycle stage is represented by a different marker, is a different size and moves in different ways. Additionally, the code has been extended to facilitate sexual reproduction, and a shrimp egg will have an equal probability of being male or female when spawned. As adult females are, on average, 1-2mm longer than their male counterparts (Tomkins and Dann, 2009), a 'Sex Multiplier' factor has been implemented to scale the size of the shrimp in the adult state based on its sex.\n",
